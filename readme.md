# IRCAutoHost

Under development. If you see something wrong in the code, its most likely intended and for showing/demostrating an idea.

------

Update: PircBot showed up to be unrealiable and unusable for this project. After this being the 3rd IRC API that fails to work with bancho, i'll be writing my own IRC client connection for the bot, which will take more time.

I've also got my last final tomorrow, so thats a reason for not working in the past week. Expect updates soon.

------

*This is a bot to be run only by me on AutoHost account and its commands / lobby usage will be public. This github is up solely for the purpose of showing the code for anyone wondering and to use as an example for other projects. Big shoutout and thanks for @ek and @ThePooN and the whole #programming channel from osu!soup discord*
